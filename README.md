This project uses SQL queries to uncover data-driven insights for a national mid-range clothing chain seeking to expand into high-potential markets. Leveraging SafeGraph datasets, we analyzed store saturation, foot traffic, demographics, and hourly visit trends to identify cities with unmet demand and favorable customer profiles.

Key Analysis:

Saturation Analysis: Flagged markets with high store density to avoid oversaturation.

High-Potential Markets: Highlighted cities with high visit rates but limited existing store presence.

Demographic Fit: Aligned cities with target customer segments such as youth, professionals, and seniors.

Per Capita Insights: Assessed regions based on store-to-population ratios to uncover underserved areas.

Peak Hour Trends: Analyzed hourly visit data to recommend store hours that align with local shopping behavior.
